# Build System

## Package Managers

### Bower
Manages Front-End Dependencies, our project files

    e.g. jQuery, Backbone, AngularJS

### NPM
Manages node environment, our development dependencies

    e.g. Glup, Bower-Sync, Plumber

## Preprocessors

Optimized syntax for addictional features

    CSS (Sass, Less, stylus)
    Javascript CoffeScript, Typescript
    HTML HAML, Jade, Markdown, Slim

## Task Runners & build Tools

### Gulp
- Learning Curve: easier to learn and maintain, code over configuration
- Speed: faster (asynscronous), streams (pipes from one file to another)


### Grunt
- Learning Curve: steeper learning curve
- relies on A LOT of configuration, syntax overly verbose
- Speed: possibly slower, has to writes to temp files
