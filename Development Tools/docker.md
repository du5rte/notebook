"It works on my machine" - Developers everywhere

## Docker
Docker bundles app with all the services it depends on in a container so it can be deployed anywhere. Docker standardises how an app is built through a simple configuration file.

## Container
You can think of a container for an app as a real-life shipping container for freight. An app container is also like a VM, but far more lightweight and with the same security and operational isolation from system resources.

### Continuous Delivery
When an app is setup so that itâ€™s easily sent through the process of build, test, and deployment. Often referred to as CI or CD (Continuous Integration or Software Delivery Pipelines).

### Dockerized App
An app that has a Dockerfile made for it and can be built into a Docker image and run as a container.


`Dockerfile`
```sh
# Dockerfile for building a MongoDB service

# Pull base image.
FROM mongo

# Define mountable directories.
VOLUME ["/data/db"]

# Define working directory.
WORKDIR /data

# Define default command.
CMD ["mongod"]

# Expose ports.
#   - 27017: process
#   - 28017: http
EXPOSE 27017
EXPOSE 28017
```

```sh
# tag the image with a name
$ docker build -t mongotest .
# build image ...

$ docker run -p 27017:27017 -p 28017:28017 mongotest
```
